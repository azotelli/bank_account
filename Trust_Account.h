/*
Trust account class: has a name, a balance, and an interest rate.
The Trust account deposit works just like a savings account deposit.

Deposit Method: any deposits of $5000.00 or more will receive a $50.00 bonus deposited to the account.

 Withdrawal Method: it should only allow 3 withdrawals per year, and each of these must be less than 20% of the account balance. There's no need to keep track of calendar time for this method, just make sure the 4th withdrawal fails.
